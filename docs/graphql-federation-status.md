# GraphQL Federation Implementation Status

## âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Foundation Architecture

We have successfully implemented the core foundation for a federated GraphQL architecture in the App SDK. This provides a solid base for the next phases of development.

### What's Been Built

#### 1. **Subgraph Interface (`graphql/subgraph/`)**

- âœ… Core `GraphQLSubgraph` interface for apps to implement
- âœ… `SubgraphConfig` for configuring subgraphs with CUE kinds
- âœ… Storage abstraction interface for delegating to existing REST storage
- âœ… Runtime subgraph creation from App Platform kinds

#### 2. **Schema Generation (`graphql/codegen/`)**

- âœ… `GraphQLGenerator` that converts CUE kinds to GraphQL schemas
- âœ… Automatic generation of CRUD operations (get, list, create, update, delete)
- âœ… Standard Kubernetes metadata types (ObjectMeta, labels, annotations)
- âœ… Resolver generation that delegates to existing storage layers
- âœ… JSON scalar types for flexible spec/status fields

#### 3. **Federated Gateway (`graphql/gateway/`)**

- âœ… `FederatedGateway` that manages multiple subgraphs
- âœ… Runtime schema composition from registered subgraphs
- âœ… HTTP GraphQL endpoint handling
- âœ… Field prefixing to avoid naming conflicts between apps
- âœ… Query routing to appropriate subgraph resolvers
- âœ… Prepared integration points for Mesh Compose + Hive Gateway

### Key Architectural Decisions Implemented

1. **Runtime Composition**: Schemas are composed at runtime for maximum flexibility
2. **App SDK Location**: Gateway lives in App SDK for reusability
3. **Storage Delegation**: Subgraphs delegate to existing REST storage (no data migration needed)
4. **Field Prefixing**: Temporary solution for field conflicts (will be enhanced with Mesh Compose)
5. **Interface-Based Design**: Apps implement `GraphQLSubgraph` interface

```

## ðŸ“‹ What Works Right Now

### Basic Federation

```go
// Create gateway
gateway := gateway.NewFederatedGateway(gateway.GatewayConfig{})

// Register subgraphs from apps
gateway.RegisterSubgraph(playlistGV, playlistSubgraph)
gateway.RegisterSubgraph(dashboardGV, dashboardSubgraph)

// Compose unified schema
schema, err := gateway.ComposeSchema()

// Handle GraphQL queries
gateway.HandleGraphQL(w, r)
```

### Auto-Generation from Kinds

```go
// Apps provide CUE kinds, get GraphQL for free
subgraph, err := subgraph.New(subgraph.SubgraphConfig{
    GroupVersion: schema.GroupVersion{Group: "playlist.grafana.app", Version: "v0alpha1"},
    Kinds:        []resource.Kind{playlistKind},
    StorageGetter: func(gvr schema.GroupVersionResource) subgraph.Storage {
        return storageLayer // Delegate to existing REST storage
    },
})
```

### Query Example

```graphql
{
  # Queries are prefixed by app domain
  playlist_playlist(namespace: "default", name: "my-playlist") {
    metadata {
      name
      namespace
    }
    spec # Auto-mapped from CUE schema
  }

  dashboard_dashboard(namespace: "default", name: "my-dashboard") {
    metadata {
      name
      namespace
    }
    spec # Auto-mapped from CUE schema
  }
}
```

## âœ… Phase 2: App Platform Integration (Current)

### Just Completed: Real App Integration

We've successfully implemented the integration between the federated GraphQL system and the App Platform's existing app provider pattern.

#### **GraphQL App Provider Integration**

- âœ… **`GraphQLSubgraphProvider` Interface**: Optional interface that app providers can implement
- âœ… **Auto-Discovery**: `AppProviderRegistry` automatically detects and registers GraphQL-capable providers
- âœ… **Storage Bridge**: Adapters bridge GraphQL storage interface to existing REST storage
- âœ… **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing apps continue to work, GraphQL support is purely additive

#### **Real Implementation Example**

The playlist app now supports GraphQL out of the box:

```go
// PlaylistAppProvider now implements GraphQLSubgraphProvider
func (p *PlaylistAppProvider) GetGraphQLSubgraph() (GraphQLSubgraph, error) {
    return subgraph.CreateSubgraphFromConfig(subgraph.SubgraphProviderConfig{
        GroupVersion: schema.GroupVersion{
            Group: "playlist.grafana.app",
            Version: "v0alpha1",
        },
        Kinds: []resource.Kind{playlistv0alpha1.PlaylistKind()},
        StorageGetter: func(gvr schema.GroupVersionResource) subgraph.Storage {
            return &playlistStorageAdapter{
                legacyStorage: p.legacyStorageGetter(gvr),
                namespacer: request.GetNamespaceMapper(p.cfg),
            }
        },
    })
}
```

#### **Auto-Discovery Pattern**

Apps are automatically discovered and registered:

```go
// Set up auto-discovery for multiple apps
registry, err := gateway.AutoDiscovery(playlistProvider, dashboardProvider)
federatedGateway := registry.GetFederatedGateway()

// Or manual registration
registry.RegisterProvider("playlist", playlistProvider)
```

#### **Storage Integration**

The `playlistStorageAdapter` bridges GraphQL operations to existing REST storage:

- âœ… GET operations â†’ `rest.Getter`
- âœ… LIST operations â†’ `rest.Lister`
- âœ… CREATE operations â†’ `rest.Creater`
- âœ… UPDATE operations â†’ `rest.Updater`
- âœ… DELETE operations â†’ `rest.GracefulDeleter`

## ðŸš§ Phase 2: Remaining Tasks

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### 1. **App Platform Integration**

- [ ] Extend existing `AppProvider` interface with `GetGraphQLSubgraph()`
- [ ] Update `apps.go` registration to include GraphQL federation
- [ ] Test with real playlist app as POC
- [ ] Verify auth/context passing through resolvers

#### 2. **Enhanced Schema Generation**

- [ ] Proper CUE type mapping (beyond current JSON scalars)
- [ ] Support for CUE constraints and validation
- [ ] Nested object type generation from CUE specs
- [ ] Input type generation for mutations

#### 3. **Relationship Support**

- [ ] CUE relationship syntax design (`@relation` attributes)
- [ ] Cross-subgraph relationship resolvers
- [ ] Automatic join field generation
- [ ] Query optimization for relationships

#### 4. **Mesh Compose + Hive Gateway Integration**

- [ ] Replace simple field prefixing with proper federation
- [ ] Implement advanced schema composition
- [ ] Add query planning and optimization
- [ ] Performance improvements

### Integration Pattern for Apps

When Phase 2 is complete, apps will get GraphQL like this:

```go
// In existing app provider (e.g., playlist)
func (p *PlaylistAppProvider) GetGraphQLSubgraph() subgraph.GraphQLSubgraph {
    // Auto-generated from existing CUE kinds
    return subgraph.New(subgraph.SubgraphConfig{
        GroupVersion: p.GetGroupVersion(),
        Kinds:        p.GetKinds(), // Already exists
        StorageGetter: p.GetStorageGetter(), // Delegates to existing storage
    })
}
```
